# BINARY SEARCH
- It eliminates one half of the array.
1) Iterative Method - 2 pointers approach & It will always be sorted array; Best for large dataset and efficient performance in memory.
2) Recursion Method - uses function recursion; slightly slower due to function call overhead.

# Rotated Sorted Array 
- Elements will be always unique 
- Search and Sorted always relate to Binary Search
- Eg. [7 8 9 1 2 3 4] target=3 find index value if it exists or else return -1

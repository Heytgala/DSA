# Binary Trees (BT)
- Types:
1) Full BT - either has 0 or 2 children
2) Complete BT - All levels completely filled except last level; last level has all nodes in "left" as possible.
3) Perfect BT - All leaf nodes are at same level
4) Balanced BT - height of tree at max "log(n)" where n is no of nodes
5) Degenerate Tree - every node has single children

# Traversal Technique - (DFS)
- Inorder Traversal (Left Root Right)
- Pre-order Traversal (Root Left Right) : TC -> O(n); SC -> O(1)
- Post-Order Traversal (Left Right Root)

# Traversal Technique - Breadth First Search (BFS) 
- Traverses level wise

# ArrayDeque
- resizable array implementation of the double-ended queue (deque) in Java.
- part of the java.util package and provides an efficient way to add and remove elements from both ends of the queue.
